# Medial-Axis-of-Polygon-Linear-Time-via-R-L
The current repository is the code implementation of the manuscript "Computing medial axis of a simple polygon in linear time based on R-L sequence" submitted to the journal Scientific Reports

The warehouse project is developed in C# language and supports the calculation of the medial axis of curved polygons, the medial axis of straight polygons, and the medial axis of hollow straight polygons
